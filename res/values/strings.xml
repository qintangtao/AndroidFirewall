    <string name="help_usage_description"><b>Using Android Firewall</b>\n<b>1.</b> Click on <b>Mode</b> to switch between <i>White List</i> and <i>Black List</i> modes.
\n<b>2.</b> Mark the applications that you want to block or allow (depending on the selected mode), for each interface.
\n<b>3.</b> Open the menu and enable the firewall. If the firewall is already enabled, just select <b>Apply rules</b>.
\nThe rules will be saved and automatically restored when you restart your phone.
\nIf you want to check all current iptables rules, select <b>Show rules</b> from the Navigation Drawer.</string>
    <string name="help_usage_widgets">\n<b>Widgets</b>\nTo quickly enable or disable the firewall with a single touch, add the On/Off Widget to your home screen.
\nTo quickly change profiles or enable/disable the firewall, add the Menu Widget to your home screen.</string>
    <string name="help_usage_logs">\n<b>Firewall logs</b>\nIf you want to see which applications have been blocked by Android Firewall, open the <i>Settings</i> menu and enable the Log.
\nAndroid Firewall will then log each application blocked. You can check the log by opening the menu and selecting <b>Show log</b> from the Navigation Drawer. 
\nSome newer devices, most notably the Nexus devices, use NFLOG instead of LOG.  Android Firewall now supports both. Devices that use NFLOG now have a pair of services that run in order to catch the data.  These services only run when logging is enabled.  
\n
\nAndroid Firewall supports logging of ACCEPTED packets as well.  By logging those packets you can see where apps are sending your data.  You can then use that information to block access to certain IPs via the Custom Script option or your HOSTS file.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_pwdsearch"><b>Password lock</b>\nYou can set a password lock for Android Firewall by using the <b>Set password</b> option in the Navigation Drawer.
\nTo remove the password protection, just reset it to blank.
\n<b>App search</b>\nYou can search for a specific app by typing the first few letters of the apps name in the search bar next to the spinner.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_interfaces"><b>Supported Interfaces</b>\nAlong side the traditional WiFi and Data interfaces, three other interfaces are now supported.  Support for VPNs, Roaming, and LANs are available.  These are enabled under <i>Settings</i>.
\n
\n<i>VPN support</i> allows apps to only access the data stream when connected to a VPN.
\n
\n<i>Roaming support</i> allows apps to access the data stream when you are roaming.
\n
\n<i>LAN support</i> allows apps to access LAN data but not the Internet.  LAN support requries the new <i>Automatic Firewall Rules</i> option in <i>Settings</i> to be enabled.  Please refer to the description for more information.
\n
\n<b>NOTE:</b><i>Automatic Firewall Rules and LAN support</i> require the Internet permission and Access WiFi State permission in order to access the Subnet and LAN address information for each interface.  <b>Android Firewall</b> in no way actually transmits data or accesses the Internet.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_tether"><i>Tethering support</i> allows you to tether a laptop/tablet/phone to your device without having to disable the firewall.  This is new and improved and no longer requires allowing "apps that run as root" and "kernel".  Bluetooth tethering interfaces are now supported by this setting.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_tasker"><b>Tasker/Locale Support</b>\n<i>Android Firewall</i> contains a plugin for Tasker and Locale.  The plugin allows those apps to Enable or Disable the firewall and change profiles based on different variables.  For more information please read the Tasker instructions under the Profiles Help tab.
\nNotifications from Tasker, Locale, and the shortcuts stating changes have been made to the firewall are disabled by default.  They can be enabled under <i>Settings</i>.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_multiuser"><b>Multi-user Support</b>\n<i>Android Firewall</i> supports multiple users on tablets.  Multi-user support requires you to use Blacklist at this time and must be enabled under Settings.  Multi-user support uses unique IPTABLES chains for each individual user so each user has control over what can access the data stream.  
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_input"><b>INPUT Chain Support</b>\n<i>Android Firewall</i> supports INPUT chains.  INPUT chains are used to prevent communication from outside sources.  INPUT chains works a little bit differently than the OUTPUT chains in <i>Android Firewall</i>.  INPUT chains applies to both WiFi and cellular data connections at the same time since there is no way to apply the rules to a specific interface.  INPUT chains works with both Blacklist and Whitelist just like current OUTPUT chains.  This feature is designed so that if you deny an app access to Data and INPUT but still want it to work on WiFi it will.  For example if you deny a web browser access the Data and INPUT but give it access to WiFi the browser will still function correctly when on WiFi.  INPUT chains only work on Android 4.x due to limitations in the older kernels.    
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_ipv6lang"><b>Other settings</b>\n
\n<i>IPv6 support</i> is available under <i>Settings</i> for those who use IPv6.
\n
\nUsers can change the apps language to one of the supported languages under <i>Settings</i>.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_sdx86"><i>SDcard support</i> for users who have moved apps to their SDcard.  This setting is now automatic.  There is no need to enable or disable it.
\n
\n<i>x86 Support</i> for devices running Intel processors.  
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_shortcuts"><i>Application Shortcuts</i> are available for quick access to enabling or disabling the firewall and all of your profiles.  These shortcuts can also be used by apps like Llama and Macrodroid for situation based application.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_media"><b>Information</b>\n
\n<i>Media Server</i> is <b>required</b> for <i>YouTube</i> to function.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_usage_reports"><i>Android Firewall</i> can generate error reports in order to gather the information needed to correct issues seen by users.  This ability generates 3 files containing device information, but NO personal information, which is then written to your external storage so you can see what is data is being collected.\n 
\nThey are kept in a folder called af_error_reports.  The files are zipped and the user given the option to e-mail the files to the developer. Please include a detailed description of what you were doing when the issue happened.
\n</string>
    <string name="help_rules"><i>Rules Management</i> is the ability to export, import, and delete rules files.\n  
        \nAll user preferences are stored in the rules file so when you export a rules file you also save your Settings like notification support, log enabled, IPv6 support, and the rest.  These files are used to create your profiles as well.
\n
\n<b>Export Rules</b> exports your current rules and settings.
\n<b>Import Rules</b> imports rules and settings from a file.
\n<b>Manage Rule Files</b> allows you to delete rules files.
\n
\n<i><b>Instructions</b></i>\n

\n5.  Touch \'No\' or \'Yes\'.  
\n
\nIf you touch \'Yes\' the rules file is deleted.</string>
    <string name="help_profiles"><i>Profiles</i> are used to quickly change the firewall rules and settings.  This is a very powerful tool as you may want a totally different set of rules depending on where you are or what network you are on.  For example, when at work your rules may be very different compared to when you are home.
\n
\nProfiles are created from rules files that you have exported so you can swap between them quickly and easily if you ever need more than 5 profiles.\n
\n<b>Create Profile</b> allows you to choose a rules file and assign those rules and settings to a profile.
\n<b>Load Profile</b> allows you to apply a profile.
\n<b>Edit Profile Names</b> allows you to edit the names of the profiles in order to make it easier to remember what profile does what.
\n
\nYou can swap profiles in a variety of different ways:
\n
\n<b>1.</b> Manually load a profile by using Load Profile.
\n<b>2.</b> Load a profile by using the dropdown spinner on the main app screen.
\n<b>3.</b> Use an app like Tasker or Locale to automatically change the profile based on time, location, or some other variable you choose.

		\n<i>Android Firewall</i> is a fork of     <i>DroidWall</i> which is a front-end application for the powerful     <b>iptables</b> Linux firewall.
		It allows you to restrict which applications are permitted to access your data networks.\n
		\nThis is the perfect solution if you don\'t have an unlimited data plan or care about your privacy.

		\n<i>Android Firewall</i> is an open source application under <b>GPL v3</b>.

    <string name="faq_help">FAQ</string>
    <string name="help_faq_one"><b>YouTube/Streaming Music is not working. How do I fix it?</b>\n<i>Please allow "Media Server" access to the Internet</i>\n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_two"><b>Why are logs not showing up?</b>\n<i>Logs depend on a service from AF that collects the data or dmesg to collect the data. Neither option can hold the data forever. So the logs are getting overritten quickly or your kernel does not have the proper modules enabled.</i>\n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_three"><b>Why do you not block SMS/MMS or Phone calls?</b>\n<i>Iptables cannot block low-level traffic like that.</i>\n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_four"><b>Why is some app not showing up in the list?</b>\n<i>The app either does not require internet permission or the app has been disabled.</i>\n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_five"><b>Why does the app request full permissions to all device features and storage?</b>\n<i>This permission is the app simply announcing that it requires root access. Here is more information on the permission: <a href="https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/T9xnMJEnzf1">https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/T9xnMJEnzf1</a>	\n
	    Giving an app root access means you give it full permissions to all device features and storage.  If you do not understand that you need to read this:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_rooting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_rooting</a></i>  	\n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_six"><b>Why does a firewall app require access to the Internet?</b>\n<i>AF does not require access to the Inernet. However, AF does need that permission in order to properly pull the ip address range for the LAN Support functionality.  AF makes no calls to the Internet.</i>\n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_seven"><b>How do I report a bug in the app?</b>\n<i>Send an Error Report from within the app (Menu -> Send Error Report) or e-mail me at androidfirewall.developer@gmail.com.  Please include the reason why you are sending the report.  For example:  "The firewall is preventing me from tethering my device" or "The firewall isn't blocking any apps."  You may also open up a bug report on Github. <a href="https://github.com/skullone/android_firewall/issues">https://github.com/skullone/android_firewall/issues</a></i> 	 \n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_eight"><b>Can you make it so this app does not need root access?</b>\n<i>No. Accessing iptables requires root access at this time.</i>\n</string>
    <string name="help_faq_nine"><b>Can you add this super duper functionality to make the apps power level over 9000?</b>\n<i>Maybe.
